                These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of and access to services provided by Maven Clinic Co.<br />

                applications, Maven’s benefits administration services, and other products and services (collectively, the<br /> 
                “Service”). Please read these applicable Terms carefully as well as the Privacy Policy before using the<br /> 
                Service. In these Terms, the terms “you” and “yours” refer to the person using the Service. Use of the<br /> 
                Service is governed by these Terms, and by using the Service you agree to abide by these Terms and all<br /> 
                applicable laws and regulations. If you do not accept these Terms, you are not authorized to access or<br /> 
                otherwise use the Service or any information or Content contained on the Service, as defined in these<br /> 
                Terms. By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms,<br /> 
                you should not use the Service.<br /><br />

                If you are using the Service in connection with an employer or health plan's agreement with Maven (an<br /> 
                "Enterprise Agreement"), then you are an "Enterprise User." We will identify below where specific terms<br /> 
                apply to you differently as an Enterprise User.<br /><br />

                <b>U.S. RESIDENTS: IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, IMMEDIATELY CALL YOUR DOCTOR OR<br /> DIAL 911.<br /><br />

                OUTSIDE THE U.S.: IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, IMMEDIATELY CONTACT YOUR DOCTOR<br /> OR EMERGENCY SERVICES.</b><br /><br />
                
                THE SERVICE PROVIDES GENERAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS INFORMATION AND A MEANS TO<br /> 
                INTERACT WITH INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONERS. IT DOES NOT REPLACE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH<br /> 
                ANY PRACTITIONER OR SERVICE, AND MAVEN ITSELF DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL OR HEALTH<br /> 
                ADVICE, CARE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT. NONE OF THE CONTENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED<br /> 
                MEDICAL ADVICE OR AN ENDORSEMENT, REPRESENTATION, OR WARRANTY THAT ANY PARTICULAR<br /> 
                MEDICATION OR TREATMENT IS SAFE, APPROPRIATE, OR EFFECTIVE FOR YOU.<br /><br />

                <b>PRIVACY</b><br /><br />
                When you use the Service, you acknowledge that we process your personal information consistent with<br /> 
                our <a href="privacy policy.html" class="cancel">Privacy Policy</a>. Because it describes the ways in which we may collect, use, and disclose your<br /> 
                personal information, this Privacy Policy is a part of these Terms.<br /><br />

                In general, we process your personal information as a “data controller” or a “business” under applicable<br /> 
                privacy laws. This means that we determine how to process and protect your personal information. We<br /> 
                also process a small amount of personal information relating to your eligibility for our Service as a “data<br /> 
                processor” or “service provider” under applicable privacy laws.<br /><br />

                When you use the Service as an Enterprise User, you acknowledge that Maven may share certain<br /> 
                personal data with your employer or health plan (including, for example, your enrollment status in a<br /> 
                particular Maven track) for billing and accounting purposes, or as otherwise may be permitted under the<br /> 
                Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (“HIPAA”).<br /><br />

                <b>MAVEN’S SERVICE</b><br /><br />

                Maven’s Service enables individuals to access to coaches and different types of service providers<br /> 
                offering their services through the Service (each, a “Practitioner”), as well as general information relating<br /> 
                to health and wellness (“Content”). More specifically, the Service enables registered users to access<br /> 
                certain content, and to communicate with Practitioners using video chat or electronic messages.<br /><br />

                The Practitioners who you engage with through the Service are independent professionals, and practice<br /> 
                as part of a group of independently owned professional practices. Some Practitioners may be licensed to<br /> 
                provide certain services, and may be acting within the scope of their license when they engage with you.<br /> 
                Maven is not practicing medicine or any other licensed profession and Maven does not interfere with<br /> 
                how Practitioners comply with the applicable state and federal requirements of their license or<br /> 
                profession. Maven merely offers you the Service in order to enable you to engage with Practitioners, and<br /> 
                is not liable for any professional advice you receive from a Practitioner.<br /><br />

                THE SERVICE IS NOT A CRISIS SERVICE. IF YOU SHARE THOUGHTS SUGGESTING HARM TO<br /> 
                YOURSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE THROUGH THE SERVICE, WE OR A PRACTITIONER MAY CONTACT<br /> 
                EMERGENCY SERVICES ON YOUR BEHALF.<br /><br />

                <b>DISCLAIMERS</b><br /><br />

                Content and other information contained on the Service is provided by Maven as a convenience. Users<br /> 
                relying on Content or other information from the Service do so at their own risk.<br /><br />

                TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” OR “AS<br /> 
                AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MAVEN DISCLAIMS ALL<br /> 
                WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR <br />
                OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br /> 
                NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES’ RIGHTS, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR<br /> 
                PARTICULAR PURPOSE. MAVEN MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE CONTENT IS ACCURATE, TIMELY,<br /> 
                UNINTERRUPTED, VIRUS-FREE OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ANY SUCH PROBLEMS WILL BE<br /> 
                CORRECTED.
